      <p>
        This project was the occasion to explore genetic algorithm with neural networks for <b>driving cars through a
          circuit</b>. My motivations to create a web app was first to experiment with browser capabilities with heavy
        parallel calculations and also to be able to share the project easily if I choose to scale it up.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole project is self-made from scratch, including car driving physics, track collisions and ray casting.
        The brain of the car is a very small deep neural network with fully connected layers.

        All the calculations are done <b>on browser</b> thanks to <a
          href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js?hl=fr">TensorflowJS</a> WASM backend.
      </p>
      <p>Each car of the first population is initialized with a random neural network that takes driving decisions
        according to the car field of view. When either the simulation time exceeds a limit or the whole population is
        crashed, a new population is created. This new population is created from the previous one by breeding the best
        individuals and randomly mutating them. This <b>genetic process</b> allows the population to <b>evolve to
          solve</b> the problem given: driving through the track.</p>

      <i>This project could evolve later as a game.</i>
